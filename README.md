# pexpo
pexpo is ping sending tui tool with cool clomun & logging loss-count in the Multi platform(Windows, Mac, Linux...).  
pexpo has tui engine is [termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go), sending ICMP engine is [go-fastping](https://github.com/tatsushid/go-fastping).  
So, pexpo's code is NATIVE [The Go Programming Language](http://golang.org) application.  
This is inspired the [pinger](https://github.com/hirose31/pinger), [Exping](http://www.woodybells.com/exping.html).
  
## Usage
```bash
Usage:
    pexpo | pexpo.exe [-i interval] [-t timeout] [-f ping-list]

Option:
    -i Sending ICMP interval time(Default:500ms, should not be lower this).
       You must not use "200" or "1" or..., must use "200ms" or "1s" or ... , so use with time's unit.

    -t Sending ICMP timeout time(Default:3s)
       You must not use "200" or "1" or..., must use "200ms" or "1s" or ... , so use with time's unit.
       this "timeout" is Exact meaning, Pinger() receives go-fastping function send value interval.

    -f Using Ping-list(Default:current_dir/ping-list.txt)
